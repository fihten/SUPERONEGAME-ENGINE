It is my first game dev experience. At first i decided to create 3d editor that can be used to create wounderful models. This approach has some advancies because my 3d editor will be based on my engine what, in turn, will allow to achieve some automatization of process of games creating. Also i plane to create IA that will be able to create model by set of object photos.
