Mechanics

What is a gameplay?
Gameplay consists of reduced set of elements which might be combined one with each other. Elements represented by actions or mechanics. On my opinion gameplay consisted from one mechanic is not intresting. Because player has no any spacious for his creativity. On the other hand too many mechanics become to form almost independent subsets of mechanics. Many subsets of independent mechanics is like many games. This case is also not interesting. Take a look at already existing mechanics. For example TETRIS. What we have. We have right-angled geometric forms falling down from top to bottom of the screen.
