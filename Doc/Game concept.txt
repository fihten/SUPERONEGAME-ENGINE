Mechanics

What is a gameplay?
Gameplay consists of reduced set of elements which might be combined one with each other. 
Elements are represented by actions or mechanics. On my opinion gameplay consisting from one mechanic is not intresting. 
Because player has no any space for his creativity. On the other hand too many mechanics become to form almost independent subsets of mechanics. 
Many subsets of independent mechanics are like many games. This case is also not interesting. Take a look at already existing mechanics. 
For example TETRIS. What we have. We have right-angled geometric forms falling down from top to bottom of the screen. 
Player's goul is to form continuous horisontal lines across entire display which will disapear. If the player doesn't contrieve to form this lines then all screen will be filled 
with the forms and game will be ended. To form continuous horisontal lines player can move geometric forms in horisontal direction and rotate them so that when they 
will fall they packed tight. Ok, horisontal movements and rotations create posibility to form tight packed set of forms. So we hsve two mechanics. I have to
notice that disapiaring of horisontal line is a reward for a player. I.e. mechanics must cause pleasure from game. 
Consider another one game. I don't like this game now. But it doesn't matter. Super Mario Bros. Player can run in horisontal directions and jump. There are many enemies that can kill the player.
To prevent it player must avoid enemies by using mentioned mechanics. Also, he can kill enemies by jumping on them, i.e. using mentioned mechanics. What i have to noticed here.
At first, game creates situations that cause player to use available mechanics. Second, game has its own mechanics. Enemies can also move in horisontal directions and jump. They can kill you by touching you.
Third, combination of mechanics can form complex mechanic. For example, moving in horisontal direction and jumping can cause death of your enemy.

Let's think about mechanics of my newly created game; This game is a first person shoter. Movements must be constraint to give players an ability to show their ingenuity. 
But abilities are not to be constrained too much. So, player can move in horisontal space + he can jump. Player cant look up or down.
What about killing of enemies? Player can use its kinethic energy. For example, he can increase his running speed, and when speed is too large,
player can jump. And if enemy isn't too far from the player and player's direction has specific value then game will help the player and push them on to the enemy. Then 
enemy will be damaged.
