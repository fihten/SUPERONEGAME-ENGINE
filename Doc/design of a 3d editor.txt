1. What elements are necessary?

There must be presented "open 3d model"/"save 3d model" buttons.
3d primitives such as sphere, cube, piramide, cone ...
2d primitives such as a square, circle, triangle ...
1d primitives such as a line
0d primitives such as a point

Editor must automatically load all shaders from a particular folder, for example, "shaders".
Then editor must parse these shaders, i.e. build hierarchy tree of lexemes.

From tree of lexemes editor can fetch all necessary objects.
In particularly it can fetch techniques and their passes.
Technique and its pass represent a graphic method applied to 3d object.

Therefore, there must be presented something like a palette of graphic methods.

Some constants and uniforms must be defined by engine user.
Among constants and uniforms there are textures, cameras, lights, structures that define light properties of material, etc.

Let's see at textures.
Textures can be fetched from files such as files with extensions png, jpg, bmp, etc.
Textures can be fetched from output of preeceding graphic method(s).

Let's see at cameras.
Cameras can be cameras controlled by gamer.
Cameras can represent light sources.
Cameras are represented by matricies.

Let's see at lights.
Lights structures are created by users.

2. How to implement these elements?
What is better? WinApi or my own widgits implemented through DirectX?
I thought about my own widgits today. The idea was to implement poping menus like start menu in windows.
But it is not origin. Perhaps, design of menu doesn't must be origin.
Maybe it must be a console?
It must be like pop uping cloud with function in it. Functions can be switched by moving mouse wheel. Functions depend on object pointed by mouse. More frequent used functions appears rather than functions that is almost not used. Pop uping ocured, for example, when user press down CTRL.
What design can be else?
Maybe i don't must concern about design now... What about to write application for reconstruction 3d model from set of photos. But at first i must to write bmp-loader.
When it will be done i think I will be already aware with WinApi enough to create more professional design.
