1. What elements are necessary?

There must be presented "open 3d model"/"save 3d model" buttons.
3d primitives such as sphere, cube, piramide, cone ...
2d primitives such as a square, circle, triangle ...
1d primitives such as a line
0d primitives such as a point

Editor must automatically load all shaders from a particular folder, for example, "shaders".
Then editor must parse these shaders, i.e. build hierarchy tree of lexemes.

From tree of lexemes editor can fetch all necessary objects.
In particularly it can fetch techniques and their passes.
Technique and its pass represent a graphic method applied to 3d object.

Therefore, there must be presented something like a palette of graphic methods.
