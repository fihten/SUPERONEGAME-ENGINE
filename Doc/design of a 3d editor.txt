1. What elements are necessary?

There is "open 3d model"/"save 3d model" buttons must be present.
3d primitives such as sphere, cube, piramide, cone ...
2d primitives such as a square, circle, triangle ...
1d primitives such as line
0d primitives such as point

Editor must automatically load all shaders from particular folder, for example, "shaders".
Then editor must parse these shaders, i.e. build hierarchy tree of lexemes.


2. How to implement these elements?
